## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#192A56), reflecting the school logo's primary color, evokes trust and authority, as well as echoing school branding.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF5FF), close to the primary hue, for a calm and professional look.
- Accent color: Yellow-gold (#D4AC0D), drawing inspiration from the accent color in the school's logo, to highlight key interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that blends modern aesthetics with warmth, ensuring a welcoming and readable experience in both Arabic and English.
- Use flat, modern icons in the yellow-gold accent color to represent event categories and seat availability. Ensure icons are culturally appropriate and easily understandable in both Arabic and English contexts.
- A clean and responsive layout optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, with a clear hierarchy of information. Utilize a grid system for consistent spacing and alignment, enhancing readability and user experience. Consider right-to-left (RTL) layout support for Arabic content.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback for interactions (e.g., seat selection, form submission). Keep animations brief and purposeful, avoiding distracting or unnecessary effects.
